To find the server id, follow instructions [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) to enable developer mode and right click the server.

You have to have node installed


### Running bot in command line
Run one of following commands to start bot:
```
npm run dev (for development vesion)
npm start (for staging version)
```


### Running corde tests on command line
You will need another bot that sends the test commands. Follow the same instructions as [above](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) to create another bot.

Add following contents to `.env` file:
```
CORDE_BOT_TOKEN=token-of-your-testing-bot-you-just-created

CHANNEL_ID=channel-for-the-tests
```

BOT_TEST_ID can be found as Application ID under General Information of your bot in [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).  
CHANNEL_ID can be found by right clicking the channel after enabling developer mode.

Once you have [invited](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#bot-invite-links) both of your bots to the server, run following command to run the corde tests:
```
npm run test:corde
```
