### About Discord

The Discord group (course channel) is for peer support for students. We recommend that you use the group with either browser-based version of Discord or Discord application (desktop app or mobile app).

The participants of the group are fellow students as well as volunteer instructors. The group's activities are voluntary. Please also help others reciprocally. However, do not share task answers in this group to avoid accidentally depriving other students of learning opportunities. The little tips are instructive and still allow for the joy of learning yourself. Thank you.

### Create your Discord account

If you’re on a desktop or mobile device, you can directly open the Discord app on your device (You can learn more information on downloading the app [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551)).

### How to use Discord

Discord is a very versalite communication platform and if you want to learn more about how to use it check [Beginner's Guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord#h_d33e3809-909b-4720-899d-db26c17bafa9).

We have created an assistant Bot that helps you. Here are instructions on how you can use it.

Commands can be used by typing to the bottom area `/` and after that the command you want to use. You can see all the available commands on the list that opens after typing `/` (shows on white text) or using the command `/help`.

If you want to leave a course, use command `/leave`. You see from the list all the courses you have joined earlier. Choose a course you want to leave from and press enter.

After you have joined a course, you can see different course channels on the left bar. At this stage there are four types of channels; announcement, general and possible added text channels and voice channel (these might change during the development).

Announcement - this is the course announcements and only teachers can make entries here.

General - main discussion area.

Voice - you can hang out over voice and video.

If you want to see who are the instructors on your course, you can use command `/instructors`.
