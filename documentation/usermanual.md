### About Discord

The Discord group (course channel) is for peer support for students. We recommend that you use the group with either browser-based version of Discord or Discord application (desktop app or mobile app).

The participants of the group are fellow students as well as volunteer instructors. The group's activities are voluntary. Please also help others reciprocally. However, do not share task answers in this group to avoid accidentally depriving other students of learning opportunities. The little tips are instructive and still allow for the joy of learning yourself. Thank you.
